* Pong
* Basic Website Generator
### Pong
This project is a basic game of ping pong, with minimal graphics such as white rectangular paddles, and a white circular ball. I used the pygame library to help me build the project.
### Basic Website Generator
This project allows users to generate a basic website or even transition between the given default website. It makes the website use HTML without the user having to write any HTML code!
